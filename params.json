Maass, H.Geyer, R.Geyer, A.Dell and S.M.Haslam: GlycoWorkbench: A Tool for the Computer-Assisted Annotation of Mass Spectra of Glycans Journal of Proteome Research, 7 (4), 1650--1659, 2008 ( PMID: 18311910)\r\n\r\nGlycoWorkbench is a suite of software tools designed for the rapid drawing of glycan structures and for assisting the process of structure determination from mass spectrometry data. The graphical interface of GlycoWorkbench provides an environment in which structure models can be rapidly assembled, their mass computed, their fragments automatically matched with MSn data and the results compared to assess the best candidate. GlycoWorkbench can greatly reduce the time needed for the interpretation and annotation of mass spectra of glycans.\r\n\r\nFirst we must thank both past and present members of Professor Anne Dell's Biopolymer mass spectrometry group within which the majority of the development of this tool has taken place. We must also give a big thanks to the Glycoconjugate biochemistry group at JLUG and especially to Tobias Lehr, which have provided continuous testing and feedback to GlycoWorkbench and made it possible to reach its current level of functionality.\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions\r\n*Make sure that your system has version 6 or latter of Java installed\r\n*Download the correct package for your system\r\n*To manually launch GlycoWorkbench run \"java -jar -Xmx300M eurocarb-glycoworkbench-1.0rc.jar\"\r\n*More detailed installation instructions can be found in the manual\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\n* [Release 1.0](https://github.com/alternativeTime/glycoworkbench/releases/download/1.0/glycoworkbench.zip)\r\n* [Release 2.0 - Windows 64bit](https://github.com/alternativeTime/glycoworkbench/releases/download/2.0-Windows-64bit/GWB_Windows_64bit.zip)\r\n* [Release 2.0 - Windows 32bit](https://github.com/alternativeTime/glycoworkbench/releases/download/2.0-Windows-32bit/GWB_Windows_32bit.zip)\r\n* [Release 2.0 - MAC](https://github.com/alternativeTime/glycoworkbench/releases/download/2.0-Mac/GWB_Mac.zip)\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
